 ## Setup
 
 To install and start the JSON-server type the following command in your terminal:
 
 ```
 npm install && npm run start:api
 ``` 

 ## How to run

  1. npm install 
  2. run the JSON-server 
  3. open the index.html file or run a static server to see your code working


 ## Tests

 A very naive implementation of test can be run using:

 ```
 npm test
 ```
 
 The test doesn't run as expected because the library Zombie doesn't make the pressButton event for local resources (name it file://*)
